# tableau-online-integration
This skill wraps a subset of the REST endpoints available on the Tableau Online. Using the Tableau Server REST API, you can manage and change Tableau Server resources programmatically, via HTTP. 

The API gives you simple access to the functionality behind the data sources, projects, workbooks, site users, and sites on a Tableau server. You can use this access to create your own custom applications or to script interactions with Tableau Server resources.
